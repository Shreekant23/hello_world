# hello_world
myself Shreekant,
I am making this to learn git and github
and this is the first branch i created, and after writing all these i am going to commit this.

Now i am updating this line here in the second branch created by me that is  My_interest branch
so i would like to add here my interest --> that is to know about everything. Scripture says that if you want to know everything means you want to know about krishna.
